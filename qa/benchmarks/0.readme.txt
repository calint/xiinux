uri '/':
  xiinux has homepage in memory while nginx is not configured to cache

files:
  xiinux sends at least two packets per file in benchmark mode.
  one packet for headers and the rest for the file. nginx does
  not do that. see notes/*-packets-*

example:
hey -n 1 -c 1 http://localhost:8088/
hey -n 1 -c 1 http://localhost:8088/qa/files/far_side_dog_ok.jpg

how to benchmark:
./do-benchmark.sh nginx localhost 80
./do-benchmark.sh xiinux localhost 8088
