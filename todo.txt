[x] change malloc to new where possible
[x] bug: sock::buf gets overwritten when content is sent thrashing the pointers
[-] ? chained requests: path, query string as std::string
    -> not supported
[x] sock: receive content -> use different buffer than the buffer used by request
[x] support for telnet with partial reads of the request
    -> chained request no longer supported
[-] if request line and headers must be read in one read then parsing that part
    of the request can be done in a simpler way
    -> multiple reads ber request
[x] valgrind
[x] abuse errors: request line length, header count, header name length, etc
    -> if total size of request (not including content) is larger than the buffer
       then exception
