[ ] bug: sock::buf gets overwritten when content is sent thrashing the pointers
[ ] MIME type for ".js" files (warning in Firefox when absent)
[ ] option for apache-bench compatibility
[ ] qa: abuse
[ ] ? chained requests
[ ]   path, query string as std::string
[ ]   headers as std::string in std::unordered_map
[ ] hierarchial widgets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] support for telnet with partial reads of the request
    -> chained request no longer supported
[-] if request line and headers must be read in one read then parsing that part
    of the request can be done in a simpler way
    -> multiple reads ber request
[x] valgrind
[x] abuse errors: request line length, header count, header name length, etc
    -> if total size of request (not including content) is larger than the buffer
       then exception
