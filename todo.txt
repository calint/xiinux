--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] sock: upload overwrites buf
[x] review the messy ssize_t size_t ops in chunky.hpp
[x] format code with standard formatter
[x] change 'int n{1}' -> 'int n = 1'
[-] option for apache-bench compatibility
    -> use other benchmarking tool 'hey'
[x] append '_' to class members
[x] examine whether functions such as 'unsafe_*' get inlined although -Os
    -> using flag -Winline shows that 'unsafe_' not found. non-inlined functions seems ok.
[x] lut: delete without recursion
[x] qa: abuse
[x] change malloc to new where possible
[x] bug: sock::buf gets overwritten when content is sent thrashing the pointers
[-] ? chained requests: path, query string as std::string
    -> not supported
[x] sock: receive content -> use different buffer than the buffer used by request
[x] support for telnet with partial reads of the request
    -> chained request no longer supported
[-] if request line and headers must be read in one read then parsing that part
    of the request can be done in a simpler way
    -> multiple reads ber request
[x] valgrind
[x] abuse errors: request line length, header count, header name length, etc
    -> if total size of request (not including content) is larger than the buffer
       then exception
